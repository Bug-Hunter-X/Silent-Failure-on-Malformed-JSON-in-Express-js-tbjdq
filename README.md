# Silent Failure on Malformed JSON in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in Express.js applications: the silent failure when processing malformed JSON requests.

## The Bug
The provided `bug.js` file shows a simple Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/users` endpoint.  It expects a JSON payload containing user data. However, it lacks proper error handling for situations where the request body is empty, not valid JSON, or missing required fields.  This leads to a silent failure; the server doesn't crash or throw an error, but it also doesn't process the request correctly.  The application continues to run, and the user receives no clear indication that there's a problem.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to implement robust error handling. This solution uses middleware to parse JSON and handles various error scenarios, providing informative error messages to both the server logs and the client.
